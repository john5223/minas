09:50 JabbaTheCabin: that's crazy, to buy puts with volatility as high as it was. that's like throwing money away.

09:39 blondetrader: we really need a pullback into some lower support to test this
09:39 radon224: I think sometimes getting "picked off" with a profit is exactly what you would want.
09:39 esmal: i dont have a hard rule, varies on stock, how the market moving and how much im willing to risk, but I generally do dollar amounts instead of percentage personally
09:39 tmoney20g: gotcha

11:05 esmal: im not suggesting anything, but I wonder if this chat has enough power to pump and dump a stock...
11:05 tmoney20g: back to flat and midline signals
11:05 YClan: jc,   usually gold miners move about 3x vs the price of the metal.   But, futures are leveraged much higher, so also a higher risk.
