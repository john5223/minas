14:26 Vimes: you first
14:27 AlphaInvestor: /ES fighting to get thru T2
14:28 Nube: I very well could, Vimes. World is still red.
14:29 Vimes: pretty darn bullish candle but who the heck knows, we gotta clear alot of junk if the bulls are going to win
14:30 MTS1: volatile candle; but still lower high and lower low.
14:31 Farmin: $TIKSP not headed to the moon
14:37 Nube: Still one heck of a candle, can't imagine anyone would be surprised to see this low hold
14:46 AlphaInvestor: Well there are some peeps in other chat rooms who think this is but a head fake (not their words)
14:57 MTS1: sure does feel like a short squeeze; but if that's what the peeps think is that the herd? (I'm too often part of the herd;))
15:02 poseidon77: Hi all... need some help showing a line for my current position price.... I have the following script:
15:02 poseidon77: def x = GetAveragePrice();
plot Data =  if x > 0 then x else close;

15:03 poseidon77: can someone help me?
15:07 Nube: first do you have an open position k. that ticker and secondly are you on an aggregation that works with the portfolio functions?
15:08 poseidon77: @Nube yes, and yes
15:08 poseidon77: @Nube its actually working but I need two improvements
15:09 poseidon77: @Nube is there a way for a line plot to plot nothing when I don't have a position; ie instead of plotting 0 and me having to re-zoom again
15:09 hguru: Reconranger here is a MACD MTF written by Nube awhile ago check it out or modify it MACD_MTF_Nube http://tos.mx/hfU1rX# This will allow you to put a MACD of a different symbol on the current chart example. /CL on a 5 min chart with the MACD of the /DX at 5 min or any other time agg above the 5 min
15:10 hguru: Or on the same chart of a 5 min and show a 15 min for example
15:10 dokk408: anyone know how to get the implied volatility of a single option...specifically, im looking for the ATM option that expires on the Friday after earnings.  
15:12 dokk408: btw, thanks to Mobius for help with GetMarketMakerMove()
15:15 amalia: yw
15:19 poseidon77: @amalia can u help me with a simple script plz?
15:19 amalia: shoot
15:20 poseidon77: I'm trying to plot a line showing my avergae position price
15:21 poseidon77: Here' what I've done so far:
def x = GetAveragePrice();plot Data =  if x 0 then x else close;
the above plots my average price correctly, and then tracks the close price when I don't have a position (instead of plotting 0). I did that in order to avoid having to re-oom everytime my poisition is zero so plot the current price instead of zero.
15:21 poseidon77: 1. is there a way to plot "nothing" when I have no position (instead of averageprice of 0)?2. is there a way to plot a horizontal line equal to only my last average price instead of the whole sequence?
15:21 amalia: exit the room and re-enter please
15:21 poseidon77: ok
15:22 poseidon77: done
15:22 amalia: Use Double.NaN
15:22 poseidon77: doesnt work :(
15:22 poseidon77: if I use Double.NaN; doesn't plot anything at all
15:23 amalia: Try something like "...if GetAveragePrice() <1 then Double.NaN else..."
15:23 Nube: What is your average price on a stock you don't own?
15:23 Nube: if IsNaN()
15:23 JohnnyQuotron: With all of the fun I was having this moring I failed to capture the "banter" from the open of the Lounge until 8:56 am eastern.  And email or PB would be appreciated.
15:23 JohnnyQuotron: And = an
15:24 Nube: I haven't tried it but I don't see why it would plot anything if you didn't have a position
15:24 Nube: Have you tried plot line = GetAveragePrice()
15:25 poseidon77: nope. lemme try that
15:25 poseidon77: oh....yes
15:26 poseidon77: i tried plot data = GetAveragePrice()
15:26 poseidon77: its the same thing right...just a diff variable name right?
15:27 poseidon77: @Nube average price is 0 if there is no position
15:28 amalia: That's why I gave you that example earlier.
15:29 amalia: plot PurchasePrice = if GetAveragePrice() == 0 then Double.NaN else GetAveragePrice();
15:30 poseidon77: @amalia @nube Double.NaN is working now.... (I could've sworn it didn't work a few minutes ago !!!)
15:30 reconranger: Thanks HGURU
15:30 poseidon77: @amalia @ nube one more thing puhleez
15:31 poseidon77: is there a way to plot a horizontal line showing just the current average price (instead of a all my average price; ie lock only to the last nonzero price?)
15:32 MTS1: yep; use close[-1]
15:32 MTS1: and IsNan() Nube gave you earlier
15:34 poseidon77: @MTS 1 close[-1] ?? I'm trying to plot GetAveragePrice()
15:35 Nube: highestAll and the use an if then the specify the current bar
15:35 MTS1: plot PurchasePrice = if IsNan(close[-1] and GetAveragePrice() > 0 then  GetAveragePrice() else Double.NaN;
15:36 amalia: JQ, you around?
15:36 MoMo: Is Mr. Script doing a webinar ?
15:38 Farmin: look it up, Education tab/webcasts
15:39 MTS1: Pose; you use IsNan and Close[-1] to determine you're on the right side of the chart as you requested. More specifically !isNaN(close) and IsNaN(close[-1]) is the last / current bar.
15:42 poseidon77: @MTS1 sorry....imma bit slow here :) .... I copied/pasted the lines you sent and it doesn't work. all red.
15:42 poseidon77: could u try it?
15:43 amalia: Missing )
15:44 amalia: IsNaN(Close[-1])
15:47 MTS1: just typed in chat; just explaining the logic. Did you follow the logic?
15:50 poseidon77: @amalia I tried that....not plotting
15:51 poseidon77: @MTS1 its not plotting anything
15:51 amalia: What's the error reason
15:52 MTS1: you can fix the syntax if you understand the logic; these are just examples: Do you follow the logic or do you have a question about any portoin what it means?
15:53 poseidon77: @amalia @MTS1 oooooh....got the problem....cuz now there is no current position so nothing to plot.... should work one I have a position
15:53 poseidon77: ok....so couple more things pleeez :)
15:54 amalia: If we stop replying, you can stop requesting.
15:54 poseidon77: is there a way to plot a horizontal line (ir extended right and left, as if it is a price level marker versus starting from the position opening ?)
15:55 poseidon77: @amalia thanks sooo much :)
15:55 fibfibfib: Hi guys, how do i add a label/bubble to a pivot line to show its S1,S2,S3,R1,R2,R3,pp on the SVE indicator. I got confuse which line is which when there are so many lines.
15:56 poseidon77: also....can i give the line a green color when the position is long and red when position is short (ie -ve quantity)
15:56 poseidon77: ?
15:57 amalia: fib, I would take all lines off your chart until you can tell me how each line is making you money.
15:58 amalia: pos, last item there can be solved by looking at the AssignValueColor() function.
15:58 Farmin: and while you're at it, explain the difference between a label and bubble
15:58 amalia: ha
16:00 fibfibfib: when there are confluences with multiple pivot lines, it adds as a stronger signal. But because there are mutliple lines, i can't tell if its S2 or S3 so if i add a label that read S2 or S3 then I know we might be bottoming
16:01 amalia: Have you looked at the AddLabeL() function?
16:01 fibfibfib: no
16:02 amalia: Might want to start there.

16:05 MTS1: and don't copy built-in indicators in here; we can look up the code in TOS;)
16:10 Vimes: which built in is that?
16:11 amalia: Post @ hh:05
16:14 Vimes: reading helps
16:37 poseidon77: @amalia.... thanks....color works now
16:54 twoshoes: Set it up as Short, Med, Long, and then "Input" values to change in study Properties.
16:55 twoshoes: You'd have to change the variable descriptions down through the study.
16:56 amalia: JQ, when you get on, I need some help.
17:16 daybuck: I was wondering if someone out the could convert a script into thinkscript for me? I don't have a clue how to even start. Thanks
17:21 amalia: The manual is a great start.
17:24 daybuck: Im sure it probably would be for someone that knows how to code but I cant even translate the code I want converted
17:31 amalia: If it's making you money, it's a worthy endeavor to start learning.
17:31 amalia: Else contact someone outside of the chatroom by other means than soliticing in here and pay them to do it for you.
17:32 daybuck: TDA told me this was the place to ask for help
17:36 amalia: You may have better luck coming back tomorrow during regular trading hours and see if anyone wants to help you. Converting is above my paygrade. What's the study? It's probably already in thinkScript.
17:38 daybuck: This is the script...It is pivot points on different timeframes
17:38 amalia: Don't paste it!
17:39 amalia: Stop!
17:39 amalia: Confirm please
17:39 amalia: daybuck!!!
17:39 daybuck: yes
17:39 amalia: Before we get to anything about code or sharing anything...
17:39 amalia: What's it called?
17:39 amalia: What's it do?
17:41 daybuck: As I said before, it is pivot points on different time frames. I dont know what else to tell you
17:43 MTS1: how are the pivots detemined?  I assme you looked at the built-in ones? 
17:44 amalia: daybuck?
17:45 daybuck: yes
17:46 amalia: Can you answer some of the questions we've provided?
17:46 amalia: daybuck, keep up or else we're moving on.
17:49 daybuck: amalia, I have answered the best I know to answer. I don't code so maybe your questions are over my head. I came here for help and nobody has even asked to see the code. Maybe if you look at it you can answer your own questions, unfortunately, I can't
17:50 daybuck: MTS1, the built in ones move on a daily basis. This code doesn't move on a daily timeframe
17:50 MTS1: So what timeframe does it move on?
17:50 amalia: See? There's one answer.
17:51 daybuck: Monthly and weekly
17:51 amalia: Don't limit yourself. You must be able to describe what you trade. We can start by the name...
17:52 MTS1: Most of the built-in ones have settings for that.
17:53 MTS1: Do you know how your script calculates the pivots? Is it using a standard method like the built-in ones or something special?
17:53 daybuck: amalia, explain your question...what do I trade. Not sure what difference it makes
17:54 MTS1: Amalia must have had a bad day; we'd like people to stick around and answer clarification questions and be as specific as they can be.
17:54 amalia: I'm here inquiring and asking questions. I must not care. lol
17:54 daybuck: Guys, don't ask me questions about the script. I cant explain it. Seems it would be much simpler to look at it.
17:54 amalia: daybuck, coders are anal. My bad if you're reading tension through text. Far from the truth.
17:54 amalia: Go ahead then.
17:55 MTS1: OK DayBreak; take a step back then: If you're trading using pivots that you don't understand you may want to revisit your trading plan?
17:55 amalia: There's the disconnect for me. "...don't ask me questions about the script. I can't explain it"
All I hear is, "I don't know how to use this study I want converted."
17:56 amalia: I'm just telling you my thought process. Don't take it personal.
17:56 daybuck: I know how to trade it on another platform but would rather have it on TOS. It just that simple
17:57 amalia: Share the script, daybuck.
17:57 MTS1: you should understand the logic behind the pivots or where they are derived / calculated from; I assume they are not random lines to you. My guess is the built-in ones do what you want already or can be a start, unless you can explain / show how your pivots are calculated differently.
17:58 mcdon0301: hi.  i put a moonphase script together( I know hocus pocus), but having issues. would anyone care to take a look? http://tos.mx/rQvJJd#
17:59 amalia: mcdon0301, here you go
http://tos.mx/J2Xh4V#
17:59 MTS1: There are at least 4 built-in pivot scripts that have slight variations how they are calculated, that all have inputs for day, week, month, or more.
18:00 daybuck: I cant even get it to paste up
18:01 amalia: daybuck, please exit and re-enter the room.
18:01 amalia: daybuck, go to pastebin.com and after you've loaded the code there, share the link here.
18:01 daybuck: ok
18:03 mcdon0301: that was fast.
18:03 MTS1: Suspect it is not the same script if you created one from scratch;)
18:04 MTS1: you can expect moonphase scripts to have issues before a full moon though; may not be your script;)
18:04 amalia: Did you even look at it? lol
18:04 amalia: nvm
18:05 amalia: -_-
18:05 mcdon0301: yes, trying to take a look
18:06 MTS1: I know Alpha has one too; ask him next time he's arround. He's proud off that one!
18:09 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current but for the gap from the open until 8:56am.  Dinner bell''s ringing.  Later gators...

18:15 amalia: I've made a MinRange for Intraday, Weekly and Monthly. Now trying to come up with a Yearly one. This one's mainly for coding practice but seem to be stuck
18:20 FunPilot: Afternoon all.  Crazy day in the market.
18:20 FunPilot: But a decent ending.
18:21 MTS1: What's the problem Amalia?
18:22 MTS1: Fun; that was NOT a fun ending for me. .
18:23 daybuck: amalia, hope this works :https://pastebin.com/RNx5vcWG
18:24 FunPilot: Sorry man.  I lost too, just not as much.  Just trying to look at the positive.
18:26 amalia: MTS1, looking through daybuck's link, looks like a HL3 on MTF?
18:26 amalia: Ok, going back to where I'm stuck...
18:27 amalia: daybuck, the code you shared, is there an author?
18:28 daybuck: I hope that wasn't a trick question....!
18:29 amalia: Someone wrote the script. Characters and syntax didn't just appead. Do you know who did?
18:29 daybuck: Im sure there is but its thru a 3rd party and Im not sure who wrote it. Sorry
18:29 amalia: Ah.
18:29 amalia: It's bad juju to share a script with no author.
18:29 amalia: Most here wouldn't touch it without it. Could be copyrighted, etc.
18:29 MTS1: DayBuck; so looks like standard pivot levels, no extensions? Is the 'special' thing the coloring based on SMA crossover?
18:30 FunPilot: If I may ask a dumb question, is there an easy stock screener on Thinkorswim to find asset classes and sub classes like Market Cap, Domestic, International, Fixed Income, Equity.
18:30 daybuck: All I know is JJ. Sorry
18:33 daybuck: From what I know, the only thing special is the pivot levels remain the same whereas the boxed ones on TOS move daily depending on the market. Reminds me somewhat of Darvas Boxes but......
18:34 MTS1: They do not; I already told you multiple times that you can change the input to not change daily
18:35 daybuck: They do not what MTS1?
18:35 MTS1: change every day if you don't want them to; they have inputs for the periods you wanted.
18:36 MTS1: (just like the script you shared)
18:37 daybuck: ok. Great. Now were getting somewhere. Back to my original proclamation. I dont code. So how do I mirror this script with the boxed one on TOS?
18:37 MTS1: have not seen one for periods less than day though; but does not sound like you were looking for the 8 hour pivot option.
18:40 daybuck: The idea is to trade off of an hourly chart at or near the monthly pivit (assuming some other criteria is met)
18:40 daybuck: Pivot
18:42 MTS1: Seriously Day; been saying that starting with my first responses. This has nothing to do with coding. Check out the built-in ones, read the tutorials at tlc.thinkorswim.com to get familiar with TOS, and ask support for a platform tour. Make sure you have 10 questions ready for them so they can show you the platform inside out.
18:47 daybuck: i had a platform tour 5 years ago when I started using TOS. I just never coded anything so I cant tell where the boxed one is different from what I wanted coded. All I know is that the two are different. The pivots are not the same as they are on the other platform
18:48 MTS1: When you set them to weekly or monthly they are not the same?
18:49 MTS1: Which ones did you try?
18:50 amalia: daybuck, if I can explain the whole situation here today is like going to McDonald's and giving the cashier a wet paper where the order was written in and not being able to give some sort of idea of what was originally there and expecting the cashier to be a sort of mind-reader. There's going to be a disconnect here until you can provide us with the author, link to the study/strategy with parameters/data, etc.
18:51 daybuck: Honestly, I havent tried personally. The fellow I got the code from told me when I asked that it didn't match the other platform because of the movement. He uses it on another platform. I would rather use TOS so I'm trying to convert it
18:52 daybuck: He used to use TOS
18:53 MTS1: Right when we started this whole (long) conversation you said you tried the built-in ones and that they changed daily, and I told you the built-in ones have settings for weekly and monthly when you said that's what you needed. We're full back now; why don't you try the built-in ones and see what you find.
18:54 sebastian2363: Hey, sorta new to the system here - I was wondering if any of you guys got EarningsPerShareTTM() to work. I can't even get it to plot.
18:54 amalia: 1h:35m of talking with daybuck. I tap out. GL daybuck.
18:54 amalia: Welcome sebastian2363.
18:54 daybuck: No problem. What do I change in the built in code to keep them from moving daily?
18:55 amalia: I was about to reply. lol No!
18:55 amalia: sebastian, did you try different tickers?
18:55 sebastian2363: I tried the default and "v".
18:55 MTS1: they'll give you a platform tour for free every 6 months
18:57 daybuck: This would have been much simpler if you could just not respond or admit you dont know how to answer the question
18:58 MTS1: I don't see EarningsPerShareTTM()?
18:59 sebastian2363: Its under the new "stock fundamentals" tab
18:59 MTS1: Oh; not a script?
19:00 sebastian2363: It is a script function
19:01 MTS1: daybuck; really/??? I know the answer, and so should you, we discussed them right in the beginning. It would have been much easier if you just were listening and honest / trying from the start.
19:03 MTS1: It does not seem like you've actually used TOS in the past 5 years and don't know how to add a built-in indicator? Do you know how to add a MA and change the settings? This is not a coding issue, this is PEBKAC.
19:04 amalia: I indulged you for more than a hour. MTS1 also concluded that we've gone full circle but you keep thinking otherwise. Here I am still replying back giving you the benefit of the doubt that you can somehow recover.
19:04 amalia: +1 MTS1
19:06 amalia: btw here are some of your pivots
def MonPivot = HL3(period = AggregationPeriod.MONTH);
def WeekPivot = HL3(period = AggregationPeriod.WEEK);
19:07 MTS1: Sebastian; have not played with those yet, but I'd try some different tickers.
19:07 amalia: daybuck has left the room. lol
19:08 amalia: "No one else can be right" attitude even when asking for help. smh -_-
19:09 sebastian2363: ok. thank you let me try
19:10 amalia: Room, what's a good way to collect Yearly OHLC values?
19:10 MTS1: But my indicator is special; I want it coded from scratch even if it already exists and I don't know what it does;)
19:11 MTS1: Amalia; O/C should be easy based on year change; would you want to use secondary aggregation for H/L or are you trying to keep it scanner friendly?
19:12 MTS1: H/L could be done that way also I guess based on year change; how many years back do you need though?
19:12 MTS1: Amalia; still there??? ;)
19:13 amalia: Yeah, going back and forth from Editor, chart then back here.
19:13 amalia: Funny link but this is what I have so far:
http://tos.mx/SedWed#
19:13 amalia: SedWed. lmao
19:17 MTS1: Not sure why yo have the extra if-then loop in there instead of 
def YearL = if YearChange==1 then L else if L<=YearL[1] then L else  YearL[1] ;
19:18 MTS1: but that's one way. Was thinking you wanted prior year OHLC which you could then carry forward. Or was thinking using monthly aggregation and getting highest, but this is easier.
19:19 amalia: I'm open to ideas really.
19:19 MTS1: (And the close obviously is the prior year's close).
19:19 MTS1: How are you using the values; how far back do you need OHLC, just prior year or current year?
19:20 amalia: This is what I'm trying to calculate:
def yearMinRange = Average(if YearC>=YearO then Min(YearH-YearC,YearO-YearL) else Min(YearH-YearO,YearC-YearL),10);
19:20 amalia: So I can't use Highest/Lowest cause that uses a rolling period
19:24 MTS1: are those current year values?
19:24 amalia: The ones in the label, yes.
19:24 MTS1: no hte yearMinRange def
19:24 MTS1: *the
19:25 amalia: Yes.
19:26 amalia: It's gonna be current until it's BNd I think
19:26 MTS1: Then you've got it already, except use the current close instead of tye Y one as that's last year's close.
19:27 amalia: But I'm trying to get last year's H/L. I can't use current values for calculation
19:27 fibfibfib: hey amalia, I just open your work on the yearly and it looks cool. Just a though, is it possible to include the open and closing price for yearly, monthly, quartley, weekly and daily?
19:27 MTS1: That's what I was asking;)
19:28 amalia: fibfibfib, it looks cool but it's not done yet. Will share when it's done.
19:28 fibfibfib: and on each line, add a bubble to say year open, year close...etc
19:29 MTS1: Then carry forward def PYH = if YearChange==1 then  YearO[1] else PYH[1]; ? 
19:29 MTS1: Sorry PYO in this case - PriorYearOpen; same for H/L
19:29 fibfibfib: thanks Amalia, MTS1.. im just beginning to learn so not as expert as you guys
19:30 fibfibfib: but so far, that's a very good idea to start on.
19:30 MTS1: WE NEED MORE BUBBLE (in SNL CowBell Voice)
19:32 amalia: lol
19:32 MTS1: Is that what you need Amalia, or am I missing something still?
19:33 amalia: Getting off desktop. that useless chat earlier fried my brain. gonna go get my green remedy on to get some cells back to attack this iead head on with more patience. =) MTS1, thanks for indulging
19:34 MTS1: lol, gn
19:34 amalia: =)
19:38 fibfibfib: don't go too long now, we need your brainpower. hahahaha
19:39 fibfibfib: just kidding

06:38 LAZY: hello
06:38 LAZY: anyone there, goodmoring
06:39 LAZY: any hard copy of thinscript manual out there??
06:50 AlphaInvestor: I will print one and mail it to you '-)
06:50 Vimes: name seems right
07:05 LAZY: wow, AlphaInvestor, great.  Can you find my address:
07:11 LAZY: hello AlphaInvestor, I copied thinkscript to word and I will print it myself.  I really appreciate your offer.  keep in touch
07:14 slashgw: lol
07:18 Farmin: Hmmm, if Lazy got together with gofast, would normal result?
07:19 Wally: Copy it to Word and make it useless, funny.
07:20 brutarie: .   Some people understand irony;   others understand ironing.  Hmmm...
07:27 Mobius: lol  Now that's a good start to the day
07:37 eayjee: is anyone able to show me how to make a cloud between 3 moving averages?
07:40 Mobius: addCloud(firstMovingAvg, SecondMovingAvg, FirstColor, SecondColor)
07:41 Mobius: addCloud(SecondMovingAvg, ThirdMovingAvg, FirstColor, SecondColor)
07:41 Mobius: addCloud(firstMovingAvg, ThirdMovingAvg, FirstColor, SecondColor)
07:42 Mobius: two different ways
07:42 eayjee: Mobius, that's awesome, what if I want to base the MA on the high or low or close?
07:43 Mobius: addCloud doesn't care
07:45 eayjee: 26 EMA, 9 period EMA off high, moved 3 periods forward, and the 9 EMA off the low, moved 3 periods forward...
07:46 eayjee: thanks for helping Mobius...red pill

07:46 JohnnyQuotron: Good morning thinkScript Lounge.  I notice that no one has lost their sense of humor.  Excellent!
07:48 Mobius: Got over a 1% globex range on high volume with price near previous close again. Whats NOT to be excited about?
07:53 LAZY: I just copied and printed out thinkscript.  Why Wally siad it is useless in word??
07:54 LAZY: I like to meet gofast :)
07:55 eayjee: mobius, is it hard to put those parameters in a script?  the instruction page wasn't too clear
07:56 eayjee: don't mean to bother and I appreciate any help
07:58 Vimes: not sure you tried very hard: see if this works

08:19 dokk408: anyone know if there's a way to get the implied volatility of an ATM call on the Friday following earnings?
------- Tuesday, October 23, 2018 -------
08:20 Mobius: there's no history for series IV
08:21 dokk408: ok, thnx
08:21 Vimes: do you mean the next series?
08:21 Sorkin: Oct 29 GE $12 puts
08:22 dokk408: im trying to track the expansion of IV as earnings approaches
08:22 Vimes: Well mobius read your mind then, no history
08:24 Vimes: You could maybe estimate it from teh ImpVolatility() plot but i'm out of my element there
08:25 tarbog: hey dmonkey.  thanks for the script on day mid.  i got it on my charts yesterday and it worked well for the day session.  thanks.  really appreciate your help.
08:26 dokk408: the ImpVolatility appears to give an aggregation of several expirations
08:44 Mobius: dokk.. There's no need to guess. All the data and method for calculating IV is listed on the CBOE in a white paper.
08:45 BenP: Good Morning.  I have squeezed an intraday chart down so small that I lost the 'Time' displayed in the X axis.  Is there any code available to deliniate the change of each day with a vertical line?
08:46 Mobius: yes
08:47 dokk408: thnx Mobius.  now i just have to learn enough so i can create a script for it so display on my charts!
08:48 Mobius: dokk.. You don't need to learn to calculate it TOS has functions to display annualized IV and all the various series IV already

or is the fed raising rates self fulfilling
06:31 blondetrader: I have 67.4 so we r spot on
06:32 blondetrader: based on yest close which was a confluence of weekly and monthly....if the low was any good price should test 68.6ish at some point in next day or 3
06:32 invertedhammer: Missed long fill at 66.4 earlier so not chasing
06:33 invertedhammer: Ha my tgt 68.53
06:33 blondetrader: rty res 31ish rn

07:07 featherweight: Woof got out of GCs in time
07:10 efu: es  no look good
07:13 Jonchew38: Dow futures pointing to a positive open - probably on back of BA earnings beat. But will the broader market be lifted up?
07:14 efu: senior, senior, your britches are tore, you better go home and get you some more , senior
07:14 blondetrader: based on dly momo we should have another day-2 sideways to down
07:14 blondetrader: but that is not to say momo HAS to complete the cycle so for es :52 is key
07:15 radon224: I predict 2 days of staring at the screen saying "WTF??"
07:15 blondetrader: any close over 58 suggests that for now bottom in
07:15 blondetrader: 35 key NQ

07:17 The100yearBULL: wow that selling pressure is consistent, huh
07:17 blondetrader: cl needs to hold 66.30 on pb to get t1
07:17 Jonchew38: many view this quarter as peak earnings and it would be downwards subsequent quarters from here
07:17 blondetrader: 22-20 gc
07:17 blondetrader: or splat
07:17 Jonchew38: the narrative from companies when they do the reporting would be impt
07:18 Jonchew38: in guiding expectations going forward
07:18 blondetrader: yep
07:18 blondetrader: gc as mentioned yesterday has a compelling sell up around 50-55
07:18 blondetrader: if the support holds that would be the next get
07:19 Jonchew38: i am bearish - think fed may be behind the curve - if tariff results in higher costs down the road... fed may be forced to hike more

08:00 tmoney20g: we've sure had some swings
08:01 blondetrader: lol
08:01 CMatc: Trying to learn to swing trade, just not having much luck finding good intel on what may be good buys
08:02 tmoney20g: not banks
08:02 tmoney20g: some of the peeps in here know how to use that "scanner" tool
08:02 tmoney20g: i haven't delved into that yet
08:03 tmoney20g: it finds things for you
08:03 CMatc: I am still trying to learn trend lines and such
08:03 tmoney20g: you on mobile or pc
08:03 CMatc: Mobile
08:04 tmoney20g: ah, increases complexity about 200%
08:04 CMatc: So setting up a PC for this would be smart?
08:04 tmoney20g: for the most efficient trading, yes
08:04 tmoney20g: multiple windows, larger charts, etc
08:05 tmoney20g: especially for quick in/outs
08:05 tmoney20g: if you're gonna trade long, mobile is fine
08:05 CMatc: Thanks, I bought SIRI today in hopes it gains after earnings
08:06 tmoney20g: trading at 6.1 right now
08:06 tmoney20g: closed at 5.95 ish
08:07 tmoney20g: i'd sell at the open, seems to be profit taking already
08:07 tmoney20g: but i'm usually wrong, so
08:13 tmoney20g: guess i don't get my amzn 1750 open
08:13 tmoney20g: could drop to that then pick back up tho

09:08 tmoney20g: crap, guess that was the low
09:09 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: sounds like good candy line,  "Loonie Big Pop".    looks like dollar bill.
09:09 blondetrader: on?
09:09 tmoney20g: nq

09:13 tmoney20g: selling begets more selling
09:13 mep1976: BLFS bio gift at these levels 
09:16 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: what happens if apple does finally decide to break?  and i don't mean just a little.
09:16 tmoney20g: then they buy their own shares
09:16 tmoney20g: and uncle warren buys as much as he can

09:18 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: buying your stock at all time highs isn't too smart imho
09:18 mep1976: nice BDSI and FNJN 
09:21 longshanks: AMD is getting its face smashed in worse than McGregor did in his last fight
09:21 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: I watched CYBR just go up over last year  :(
09:22 longshanks: kiking myself for not buying that put.
09:22 tmoney20g: next time buddy
09:23 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: MU is undercutting Feb low at 37.50.   Might reverse.  Why i didn't short it recently i don't know.
09:23 longshanks: always next time haha
09:26 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: one stock was holding the trap door open.
09:26 Ken: I want to sell my JD this morning, but I type the quantity 170, in my account it have only 160, now I want to confirm did I already sell my JD or it is no action for my trade
09:28 blondetrader: well on the bright side
09:28 blondetrader: if we get down around lows from yeaterday we may see the capit we didnt see yeaterday
09:28 blondetrader: yest
09:29 blondetrader: and that might be good for at leaST a short term low and some rally time
09:29 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: longshank, if we're going into a bear market, trust me, there will be penty of opportunities to short.
09:29 radon224: Confucius Say: Wise Man Never Play Leapfrog with Unicorn
09:30 blondetrader: lol
09:30 radon224: EIA Oil report out
09:30 tmoney20g: bt, gotta nother nq low point ?
09:31 blondetrader: 7020-10
09:31 tmoney20g: oh, 6980
09:31 tmoney20g: i drew a line, was off the chart
09:31 tmoney20g: lol
09:31 blondetrader: well if that low breaks u can extepct a break of yest lows
09:32 blondetrader: fwiw only nq did not make a new one
09:32 blondetrader: so might need to get that out of way
09:32 blondetrader: bt i promise we have some rally coming lol
09:32 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: find charts of stocks in downtrends, then when earnings come out and they miss during eco downturn, the stock plunges.   Made a lot of cash doing that in bear markets.
09:33 blondetrader: well we have a lot to break if this is really gonna b a bear
09:33 blondetrader: and the next rally will determine that
09:33 blondetrader: mkt doesnt just wake up and say we are done the change will be evident
09:34 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: yes early in a eco downturn some companies will always beat on earnings, so the market gets propped up, backing and filling.
09:34 blondetrader: in all likelyhood that decision will be in mid 2800s es
09:35 efu: America is now oficially Great:  congrats
09:35 blondetrader: well cant go on forever
09:35 blondetrader: but from here I dont think we r done.....
09:36 blondetrader: 7100 R nq
09:36 blondetrader: 37 es
09:36 TnT: beans fresh low
09:36 blondetrader: 26 rty
09:37 efu: bt thanksfor your work
09:37 tmoney20g: bt is amazing
09:37 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: It's  a conspiracy.  Since when does the fed announce ahead of time they are going to raise rates 3 times in the coming year?  I've never seen nor heard of it!
09:37 efu: nice to  have a check  of things
09:37 tmoney20g: started that lately, they want to be more "transparent"
09:37 fred__w: one hr in  and one boundary cross down  time for coffee
09:38 TnT: they have been doing that a few years now,  where have you been?
09:38 tmoney20g: under a large boulder
09:38 esmal: morning
09:38 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: gotta say blonde, you are good at picking support levels even if only temporary!
09:38 tmoney20g: hi esmal
09:38 blondetrader: :)
09:40 Br: you think igc will go back up in the long run
09:40 blondetrader: rty if 15 breaks 1504 is the overlap
09:41 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: never heard of them announcing they will raise 3 times in the future.  For one thing it is idiotic policy bc the fed cannot forecast that far ahead.  
09:42 TnT: forecast is what they consider likely, it is always subject to changes in data
09:42 esmal: hey tmoney
09:43 TnT: you must not have ever read their released statements or watched their press conferences
09:44 TnT: so, no, they do not  have an idiotic  policy
09:44 streetglide: Id rather try to figure out bt's charts than read that boring chit
09:44 TnT: policy may not be great, but they do think about it
09:45 TnT: /es 770k
09:45 blondetrader: hmmm
09:46 blondetrader: es 16 gets taken out should confirm yest was not the low
09:46 TnT: DOOM
09:46 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: they did do a good job of duping savers out of interest income for 10 years by keeping rates at ZERO.  
09:46 blondetrader: 2688-4 would be next 65 ultimate
09:46 blondetrader: anything under that =45
09:46 blondetrader: but I dont think thats in cards at this point
09:47 TnT: NLT
09:47 TnT: -804
09:47 MyOtherBrotherDarryl: my bank still pays 0.01% interest in checking but 20% on credit card interest.   needless to say i took most of my money out.
09:47 blondetrader: es at the 60s Id do something long
09:48 tmoney20g: .01% is solid, lol
09:48 fred__w: 2nd boundary breach down
09:48 JabbaTheCabin: 60's? you mean 2660 on es?
09:49 TnT: Ai is missing, did  he buy the 1.6 b ticket?
09:49 blondetrader: yes
09:49 blondetrader: 2665ish
09:49 blondetrader: and 2645 are HTF big #s
09:49 JabbaTheCabin: with the moves we have been getting, that could hapopen today
09:49 invertedhammer: 2720 may hold it up
09:49 blondetrader: on the first if it test and holds that should be the rally point
09:49 blondetrader: 4 hr momo suggests nsl
09:49 blondetrader: if it ran the whole rotation
09:50 blondetrader: so we have a bigger pic theory and need to use the smaller tf # to see it thru
09:50 RandomDan: very, very choppy
09:50 tmoney20g: yes
09:50 tmoney20g: only 4 1725 puts traded today on amzn
09:50 tmoney20g: guess no one's betting down
09:51 blondetrader: honestly dan even with the wide swings if u look at it in chunks its been very orderly
09:51 tmoney20g: lots of calls sold tho
09:51 blondetrader: for us it would be better to just rip the bandaid off
09:51 YClan: Boring market, if you ask me... (you didn't).
09:52 RandomDan: patience bt
09:52 blondetrader: es 2665s we could get to 2775-90 likcity split
09:52 blondetrader: haha dan I am on a time schedule
09:52 RandomDan: you are on a hurry
09:52 tmoney20g: Yclan likes mayhem days
09:52 RandomDan: in
09:52 blondetrader: I have a plan for next week ......wonder if mkt even give one small F about that 
09:53 tmoney20g: any plan for amzn earnings ? ;)
09:53 streetglide: no bt
09:53 blondetrader: I am in a short Back ratio AMZN
09:53 blondetrader: haha street.....I know but a girl can dream
09:53 streetglide: yes
09:53 tmoney20g: morgan's so cute
09:54 streetglide: mid morning cat for chen
09:54 RandomDan: bt, we live in a world where a dead wapo journo means people will be buying cheaper gas. Events are connected in strange ways.
09:54 invertedhammer: Es on 5 min u could short every pop to 21 ema
09:54 YClan: AMZN earnings... they need to blow it big.  just slightly beating will end up in a downward move.
09:54 tmoney20g: they missed rev's last quarter and it was up
09:55 RandomDan: YClan, guidance is more important
09:55 YClan: tmo,  that was a different market/expectation
09:55 tmoney20g: stock is currently 100 less than pre-er last quarter
09:55 RandomDan: AMZN is close to being a cult stock
09:55 tmoney20g: which is a good bit off its high now
09:56 RandomDan: not quite TSLA, but the Bezos faithful are many
09:56 tmoney20g: i mean, i'm not shooting for the moon with way otm options
09:56 tmoney20g: i'll just play like 1x c1800
09:56 tmoney20g: same as today
09:56 RandomDan: vol will be your problem
09:57 tmoney20g: vol is the problem all week
09:57 YClan: NFLX had big earnings beat, but they are down quite a bit.
09:57 tmoney20g: well you're talking a week after er now
09:57 tmoney20g: i'll be selling whatever i have at 931am the next morning
09:58 RandomDan: also the $2B junk bond placement
09:58 tmoney20g: they did have their biggest prime day ever
09:58 tmoney20g: even with the glitch
09:58 blondetrader: if cmg can drop another 10 might look nice for some up into E
09:59 YClan: speaking of Prime day...   we have Singles day in China and BABA usually hypes it up for a big sales day...    Nov 11.  (11/11, all singles/ones).
09:59 RandomDan: if I was playing AMZN I would sell put spreads
08:56 willie_sutton: gm all
08:56 BenP: Hi Mobius.  Was that 'yes' for me?
08:59 MTS1: Yes
08:59 MTS1: Look at AddVerticalLine() function
08:59 MTS1: or just put vertical in the left-top filter box in the reference
08:59 MTS1: (to find available functions)
09:02 MTS1: next you'll probably look in the date/time section to find the function to determine if the day changed to use in the vertical line function.
09:04 BenP: gotcha.  thanks !!
09:04 MTS1: yw
09:10 Paris: BenP - Here's an example on plotting a vertical line
# Vertical Line on New Day
# 9.17.2018
def today = getDay() == getLastDay();
addVerticalLine(today and !Today[1], "New Day", color.cyan, curve.short_dash);
09:11 Vimes: i wonder how many total mobius snippets are out there, 1000, 2000?  :) :)
09:12 Paris: I must have at least 500+ snort snippets
09:12 fibfibfib: Hi Mobius, if there a way to automatically fib measure the prior week and month?
09:12 Mobius: fibfib.. yes
09:12 fibfibfib: or does anyone know how?
09:15 Mobius: you already have the Auto Fib Study. Just change the iData to whatever higher aggregation you want
09:17 Paris: whoops, typo: snort = short. LOL!
09:17 willie_sutton: anyone found a way to plot option delta for mulpiple strikes on a lower?
09:18 Vimes: lol, didn't notice
09:18 Mobius: I prefer snort Paris... Fits me better  :)
09:18 Paris: Heh!
09:18 Vimes: a snort of jd
09:20 Mobius: willie.. that could be done as long as you don't try to  get much more than 1 or 2 strikes away from ATM
09:20 willie_sutton: Hi Mobius - that woud be fine with me
09:21 willie_sutton: I hope you're well
09:21 Mobius: then use the Options Dashboard or any of the other studies I've written for a template to get the OPRA symbols. From there you can calculate delta or get it from TOS data
09:22 Mobius: /ES is giving me that sinking feeling
09:23 Vimes: buyers just can't get it done
09:24 Mobius: looks like pros selling into any rally. Volume goes down on a rise and way up on a fall. Energy is on the down side.
09:26 Mobius: Now a days that could change in a minute. Used to be, at the first sign of energy higher going down it was a clear sign to go to a higher cash weighting or to hedge tight. Now it's just not so clearcut.
09:27 Vimes: interesting

09:28 Vimes: i think the chemical market has become so savy on passing on formula pricing based on raws perhaps in the old days they weren't as clver
09:28 Vimes: clever
09:28 mthfr_vaxxed: Any reasons you know of why October is so gloomy usually? Black Thursday from 1929 still scaring everyone? or something else?
09:30 Mobius: mth.. There's 100 opinions about that if there's 1. Best source in my opnion is Traders Almanac
09:30 willie_sutton: I should say that I've been looking at your option dashboard as well, but I'm not sure how it works.  I'm slow as you know.  I understand that you calculated an approximate delta, but i'm unsure how that would be applied across multiple strikes.  I'll keep at it.
09:31 Vimes: externals might not stick - but a site that allows a quick view of seasonal trends
http://marketqview.com/seasonalchart.php?ID=75
09:33 Vimes: would suggest october is actually historically strong into eoy
09:41 MTS1: Willie; it would be cool if you left headers / attribution / comments in the code.
09:42 MTS1: and give it a name
09:44 willie_sutton: agreed
09:45 willie_sutton: Call it:
#it plots the bid and ask of a manually entered option.
09:47 cajun: willie, building on MTS, how bout specifying what you changed/added to mobius work
09:48 willie_sutton: apologies to all
09:50 Paris: MTS - I've annotated Willie's suggested nomenclature on my end. All good on my end
09:50 MTS1: Appreciate the sharing! Just feedback as I didn' see headers or what it does or attribution to original code / enhancements. I see you left comments in further down, but a header would be nice.
09:52 willie_sutton: all the attributions were mobius'
09:53 kjg: Hello - can anyone tell me how to add a chart to show a study only.  don't need price..
09:54 Vimes: somewhere in settings hide price
09:55 MTS1: There's a function also to do it in a script; just searched for hide in the reference; hidePricePlot()
09:57 Paris: Willie, since your posted study plots the bid/ask of a manually entered option, I have tagged your study with the following header in my archives as a placeholder.
# Bid and Ask OPRA Code
# willie_sutton
# 10.24.2018
09:57 willie_sutton: i love that
09:57 Paris: Thanks for your contribution Willie!
09:58 kjg: Vimes, MTS1 - thank you - I'll check it out
10:00 willie_sutton: I must admit that i didn't fuly understand Mobius' cloud shading; so you can add this if you like:
# for addCloud, green denotes when someone hits the ask price, red denotes hitting the bid
10:01 Paris: Noted
10:06 JohnnyQuotron: Willie... like Paris I will be adding a header to the mobius script you altered.  Please, where ever possible add an authorship header to your scripts and if you are adjusting someone else's code comments regarding the changes are particularly helpful.  Mobius code is considered the "Gold Standard" and relied upon without hesitation..  if you are adjusting his code, particularly his logic or math, it is critical that those looking at your script next week or next year know where it deviated from the "Gold Standard".  Thank you.
10:17 DMonkey: gm.....

10:17 JohnnyQuotron: Morning D
10:18 willie_sutton: Sorry johnny, I'm new here
10:20 Nube: Traders Almanac is a great book to the get the hamster wheel spinning.
10:30 JohnnyQuotron: willie... no need to be sorry.  I apologize if I came of as being gruff.  I'm glad you're here and contributing.  I'm just thinking about a Community OneNote reader looking at your script six months from now.  If you haven't visited the Community OneNote here is the public link    https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnkeHrrRM_cvgxQTl1xckINYlKhZ
10:32 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current.  BBL
10:32 Mobius: DMonkey - Love your naming convention in that study. So creative  :)
10:36 JohnnyQuotron: Mobius... imagine Limbo Bars using that naming convention xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
