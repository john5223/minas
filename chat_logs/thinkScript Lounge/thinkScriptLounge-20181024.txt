14:26 Vimes: you first
14:27 AlphaInvestor: /ES fighting to get thru T2
14:28 Nube: I very well could, Vimes. World is still red.
14:29 Vimes: pretty darn bullish candle but who the heck knows, we gotta clear alot of junk if the bulls are going to win
14:30 MTS1: volatile candle; but still lower high and lower low.
14:31 Farmin: $TIKSP not headed to the moon
14:37 Nube: Still one heck of a candle, can't imagine anyone would be surprised to see this low hold
14:46 AlphaInvestor: Well there are some peeps in other chat rooms who think this is but a head fake (not their words)
14:57 MTS1: sure does feel like a short squeeze; but if that's what the peeps think is that the herd? (I'm too often part of the herd;))
15:02 poseidon77: Hi all... need some help showing a line for my current position price.... I have the following script:
15:02 poseidon77: def x = GetAveragePrice();
plot Data =  if x > 0 then x else close;

15:03 poseidon77: can someone help me?
15:07 Nube: first do you have an open position k. that ticker and secondly are you on an aggregation that works with the portfolio functions?
15:08 poseidon77: @Nube yes, and yes
15:08 poseidon77: @Nube its actually working but I need two improvements
15:09 poseidon77: @Nube is there a way for a line plot to plot nothing when I don't have a position; ie instead of plotting 0 and me having to re-zoom again
15:09 hguru: Reconranger here is a MACD MTF written by Nube awhile ago check it out or modify it MACD_MTF_Nube http://tos.mx/hfU1rX# This will allow you to put a MACD of a different symbol on the current chart example. /CL on a 5 min chart with the MACD of the /DX at 5 min or any other time agg above the 5 min
15:10 hguru: Or on the same chart of a 5 min and show a 15 min for example
15:10 dokk408: anyone know how to get the implied volatility of a single option...specifically, im looking for the ATM option that expires on the Friday after earnings.  
15:12 dokk408: btw, thanks to Mobius for help with GetMarketMakerMove()
15:15 amalia: yw
15:19 poseidon77: @amalia can u help me with a simple script plz?
15:19 amalia: shoot
15:20 poseidon77: I'm trying to plot a line showing my avergae position price
15:21 poseidon77: Here' what I've done so far:
def x = GetAveragePrice();plot Data =  if x 0 then x else close;
the above plots my average price correctly, and then tracks the close price when I don't have a position (instead of plotting 0). I did that in order to avoid having to re-oom everytime my poisition is zero so plot the current price instead of zero.
15:21 poseidon77: 1. is there a way to plot "nothing" when I have no position (instead of averageprice of 0)?2. is there a way to plot a horizontal line equal to only my last average price instead of the whole sequence?
15:21 amalia: exit the room and re-enter please
15:21 poseidon77: ok
15:22 poseidon77: done
15:22 amalia: Use Double.NaN
15:22 poseidon77: doesnt work :(
15:22 poseidon77: if I use Double.NaN; doesn't plot anything at all
15:23 amalia: Try something like "...if GetAveragePrice() <1 then Double.NaN else..."
15:23 Nube: What is your average price on a stock you don't own?
15:23 Nube: if IsNaN()
15:23 JohnnyQuotron: With all of the fun I was having this moring I failed to capture the "banter" from the open of the Lounge until 8:56 am eastern.  And email or PB would be appreciated.
15:23 JohnnyQuotron: And = an
15:24 Nube: I haven't tried it but I don't see why it would plot anything if you didn't have a position
15:24 Nube: Have you tried plot line = GetAveragePrice()
15:25 poseidon77: nope. lemme try that
15:25 poseidon77: oh....yes
15:26 poseidon77: i tried plot data = GetAveragePrice()
15:26 poseidon77: its the same thing right...just a diff variable name right?
15:27 poseidon77: @Nube average price is 0 if there is no position
15:28 amalia: That's why I gave you that example earlier.
15:29 amalia: plot PurchasePrice = if GetAveragePrice() == 0 then Double.NaN else GetAveragePrice();
15:30 poseidon77: @amalia @nube Double.NaN is working now.... (I could've sworn it didn't work a few minutes ago !!!)
15:30 reconranger: Thanks HGURU
15:30 poseidon77: @amalia @ nube one more thing puhleez
15:31 poseidon77: is there a way to plot a horizontal line showing just the current average price (instead of a all my average price; ie lock only to the last nonzero price?)
15:32 MTS1: yep; use close[-1]
15:32 MTS1: and IsNan() Nube gave you earlier
15:34 poseidon77: @MTS 1 close[-1] ?? I'm trying to plot GetAveragePrice()
15:35 Nube: highestAll and the use an if then the specify the current bar
15:35 MTS1: plot PurchasePrice = if IsNan(close[-1] and GetAveragePrice() > 0 then  GetAveragePrice() else Double.NaN;
15:36 amalia: JQ, you around?
15:36 MoMo: Is Mr. Script doing a webinar ?
15:38 Farmin: look it up, Education tab/webcasts
15:39 MTS1: Pose; you use IsNan and Close[-1] to determine you're on the right side of the chart as you requested. More specifically !isNaN(close) and IsNaN(close[-1]) is the last / current bar.
15:42 poseidon77: @MTS1 sorry....imma bit slow here :) .... I copied/pasted the lines you sent and it doesn't work. all red.
15:42 poseidon77: could u try it?
15:43 amalia: Missing )
15:44 amalia: IsNaN(Close[-1])
15:47 MTS1: just typed in chat; just explaining the logic. Did you follow the logic?
15:50 poseidon77: @amalia I tried that....not plotting
15:51 poseidon77: @MTS1 its not plotting anything
15:51 amalia: What's the error reason
15:52 MTS1: you can fix the syntax if you understand the logic; these are just examples: Do you follow the logic or do you have a question about any portoin what it means?
15:53 poseidon77: @amalia @MTS1 oooooh....got the problem....cuz now there is no current position so nothing to plot.... should work one I have a position
15:53 poseidon77: ok....so couple more things pleeez :)
15:54 amalia: If we stop replying, you can stop requesting.
15:54 poseidon77: is there a way to plot a horizontal line (ir extended right and left, as if it is a price level marker versus starting from the position opening ?)
15:55 poseidon77: @amalia thanks sooo much :)
15:55 fibfibfib: Hi guys, how do i add a label/bubble to a pivot line to show its S1,S2,S3,R1,R2,R3,pp on the SVE indicator. I got confuse which line is which when there are so many lines.
15:56 poseidon77: also....can i give the line a green color when the position is long and red when position is short (ie -ve quantity)
15:56 poseidon77: ?
15:57 amalia: fib, I would take all lines off your chart until you can tell me how each line is making you money.
15:58 amalia: pos, last item there can be solved by looking at the AssignValueColor() function.
15:58 Farmin: and while you're at it, explain the difference between a label and bubble
15:58 amalia: ha
16:00 fibfibfib: when there are confluences with multiple pivot lines, it adds as a stronger signal. But because there are mutliple lines, i can't tell if its S2 or S3 so if i add a label that read S2 or S3 then I know we might be bottoming
16:01 amalia: Have you looked at the AddLabeL() function?
16:01 fibfibfib: no
16:02 amalia: Might want to start there.

16:05 MTS1: and don't copy built-in indicators in here; we can look up the code in TOS;)
16:10 Vimes: which built in is that?
16:11 amalia: Post @ hh:05
16:14 Vimes: reading helps
16:37 poseidon77: @amalia.... thanks....color works now
16:54 twoshoes: Set it up as Short, Med, Long, and then "Input" values to change in study Properties.
16:55 twoshoes: You'd have to change the variable descriptions down through the study.
16:56 amalia: JQ, when you get on, I need some help.
17:16 daybuck: I was wondering if someone out the could convert a script into thinkscript for me? I don't have a clue how to even start. Thanks
17:21 amalia: The manual is a great start.
17:24 daybuck: Im sure it probably would be for someone that knows how to code but I cant even translate the code I want converted
17:31 amalia: If it's making you money, it's a worthy endeavor to start learning.
17:31 amalia: Else contact someone outside of the chatroom by other means than soliticing in here and pay them to do it for you.
17:32 daybuck: TDA told me this was the place to ask for help
17:36 amalia: You may have better luck coming back tomorrow during regular trading hours and see if anyone wants to help you. Converting is above my paygrade. What's the study? It's probably already in thinkScript.
17:38 daybuck: This is the script...It is pivot points on different timeframes
17:38 amalia: Don't paste it!
17:39 amalia: Stop!
17:39 amalia: Confirm please
17:39 amalia: daybuck!!!
17:39 daybuck: yes
17:39 amalia: Before we get to anything about code or sharing anything...
17:39 amalia: What's it called?
17:39 amalia: What's it do?
17:41 daybuck: As I said before, it is pivot points on different time frames. I dont know what else to tell you
17:43 MTS1: how are the pivots detemined?  I assme you looked at the built-in ones? 
17:44 amalia: daybuck?
17:45 daybuck: yes
17:46 amalia: Can you answer some of the questions we've provided?
17:46 amalia: daybuck, keep up or else we're moving on.
17:49 daybuck: amalia, I have answered the best I know to answer. I don't code so maybe your questions are over my head. I came here for help and nobody has even asked to see the code. Maybe if you look at it you can answer your own questions, unfortunately, I can't
17:50 daybuck: MTS1, the built in ones move on a daily basis. This code doesn't move on a daily timeframe
17:50 MTS1: So what timeframe does it move on?
17:50 amalia: See? There's one answer.
17:51 daybuck: Monthly and weekly
17:51 amalia: Don't limit yourself. You must be able to describe what you trade. We can start by the name...
17:52 MTS1: Most of the built-in ones have settings for that.
17:53 MTS1: Do you know how your script calculates the pivots? Is it using a standard method like the built-in ones or something special?
17:53 daybuck: amalia, explain your question...what do I trade. Not sure what difference it makes
17:54 MTS1: Amalia must have had a bad day; we'd like people to stick around and answer clarification questions and be as specific as they can be.
17:54 amalia: I'm here inquiring and asking questions. I must not care. lol
17:54 daybuck: Guys, don't ask me questions about the script. I cant explain it. Seems it would be much simpler to look at it.
17:54 amalia: daybuck, coders are anal. My bad if you're reading tension through text. Far from the truth.
17:54 amalia: Go ahead then.
17:55 MTS1: OK DayBreak; take a step back then: If you're trading using pivots that you don't understand you may want to revisit your trading plan?
17:55 amalia: There's the disconnect for me. "...don't ask me questions about the script. I can't explain it"
All I hear is, "I don't know how to use this study I want converted."
17:56 amalia: I'm just telling you my thought process. Don't take it personal.
17:56 daybuck: I know how to trade it on another platform but would rather have it on TOS. It just that simple
17:57 amalia: Share the script, daybuck.
17:57 MTS1: you should understand the logic behind the pivots or where they are derived / calculated from; I assume they are not random lines to you. My guess is the built-in ones do what you want already or can be a start, unless you can explain / show how your pivots are calculated differently.
17:58 mcdon0301: hi.  i put a moonphase script together( I know hocus pocus), but having issues. would anyone care to take a look? http://tos.mx/rQvJJd#
17:59 amalia: mcdon0301, here you go
http://tos.mx/J2Xh4V#
17:59 MTS1: There are at least 4 built-in pivot scripts that have slight variations how they are calculated, that all have inputs for day, week, month, or more.
18:00 daybuck: I cant even get it to paste up
18:01 amalia: daybuck, please exit and re-enter the room.
18:01 amalia: daybuck, go to pastebin.com and after you've loaded the code there, share the link here.
18:01 daybuck: ok
18:03 mcdon0301: that was fast.
18:03 MTS1: Suspect it is not the same script if you created one from scratch;)
18:04 MTS1: you can expect moonphase scripts to have issues before a full moon though; may not be your script;)
18:04 amalia: Did you even look at it? lol
18:04 amalia: nvm
18:05 amalia: -_-
18:05 mcdon0301: yes, trying to take a look
18:06 MTS1: I know Alpha has one too; ask him next time he's arround. He's proud off that one!
18:09 JohnnyQuotron: The LoungeArchive is current but for the gap from the open until 8:56am.  Dinner bell''s ringing.  Later gators...

18:15 amalia: I've made a MinRange for Intraday, Weekly and Monthly. Now trying to come up with a Yearly one. This one's mainly for coding practice but seem to be stuck
18:20 FunPilot: Afternoon all.  Crazy day in the market.
18:20 FunPilot: But a decent ending.
18:21 MTS1: What's the problem Amalia?
18:22 MTS1: Fun; that was NOT a fun ending for me. .
18:23 daybuck: amalia, hope this works :https://pastebin.com/RNx5vcWG
18:24 FunPilot: Sorry man.  I lost too, just not as much.  Just trying to look at the positive.
18:26 amalia: MTS1, looking through daybuck's link, looks like a HL3 on MTF?
18:26 amalia: Ok, going back to where I'm stuck...
18:27 amalia: daybuck, the code you shared, is there an author?
18:28 daybuck: I hope that wasn't a trick question....!
18:29 amalia: Someone wrote the script. Characters and syntax didn't just appead. Do you know who did?
18:29 daybuck: Im sure there is but its thru a 3rd party and Im not sure who wrote it. Sorry
18:29 amalia: Ah.
18:29 amalia: It's bad juju to share a script with no author.
18:29 amalia: Most here wouldn't touch it without it. Could be copyrighted, etc.
18:29 MTS1: DayBuck; so looks like standard pivot levels, no extensions? Is the 'special' thing the coloring based on SMA crossover?
18:30 FunPilot: If I may ask a dumb question, is there an easy stock screener on Thinkorswim to find asset classes and sub classes like Market Cap, Domestic, International, Fixed Income, Equity.
18:30 daybuck: All I know is JJ. Sorry
18:33 daybuck: From what I know, the only thing special is the pivot levels remain the same whereas the boxed ones on TOS move daily depending on the market. Reminds me somewhat of Darvas Boxes but......
18:34 MTS1: They do not; I already told you multiple times that you can change the input to not change daily
18:35 daybuck: They do not what MTS1?
18:35 MTS1: change every day if you don't want them to; they have inputs for the periods you wanted.
18:36 MTS1: (just like the script you shared)
18:37 daybuck: ok. Great. Now were getting somewhere. Back to my original proclamation. I dont code. So how do I mirror this script with the boxed one on TOS?
18:37 MTS1: have not seen one for periods less than day though; but does not sound like you were looking for the 8 hour pivot option.
18:40 daybuck: The idea is to trade off of an hourly chart at or near the monthly pivit (assuming some other criteria is met)
18:40 daybuck: Pivot
18:42 MTS1: Seriously Day; been saying that starting with my first responses. This has nothing to do with coding. Check out the built-in ones, read the tutorials at tlc.thinkorswim.com to get familiar with TOS, and ask support for a platform tour. Make sure you have 10 questions ready for them so they can show you the platform inside out.
18:47 daybuck: i had a platform tour 5 years ago when I started using TOS. I just never coded anything so I cant tell where the boxed one is different from what I wanted coded. All I know is that the two are different. The pivots are not the same as they are on the other platform
18:48 MTS1: When you set them to weekly or monthly they are not the same?
18:49 MTS1: Which ones did you try?
18:50 amalia: daybuck, if I can explain the whole situation here today is like going to McDonald's and giving the cashier a wet paper where the order was written in and not being able to give some sort of idea of what was originally there and expecting the cashier to be a sort of mind-reader. There's going to be a disconnect here until you can provide us with the author, link to the study/strategy with parameters/data, etc.
18:51 daybuck: Honestly, I havent tried personally. The fellow I got the code from told me when I asked that it didn't match the other platform because of the movement. He uses it on another platform. I would rather use TOS so I'm trying to convert it
18:52 daybuck: He used to use TOS
18:53 MTS1: Right when we started this whole (long) conversation you said you tried the built-in ones and that they changed daily, and I told you the built-in ones have settings for weekly and monthly when you said that's what you needed. We're full back now; why don't you try the built-in ones and see what you find.
18:54 sebastian2363: Hey, sorta new to the system here - I was wondering if any of you guys got EarningsPerShareTTM() to work. I can't even get it to plot.
18:54 amalia: 1h:35m of talking with daybuck. I tap out. GL daybuck.
18:54 amalia: Welcome sebastian2363.
18:54 daybuck: No problem. What do I change in the built in code to keep them from moving daily?
18:55 amalia: I was about to reply. lol No!
18:55 amalia: sebastian, did you try different tickers?
18:55 sebastian2363: I tried the default and "v".
18:55 MTS1: they'll give you a platform tour for free every 6 months
18:57 daybuck: This would have been much simpler if you could just not respond or admit you dont know how to answer the question
18:58 MTS1: I don't see EarningsPerShareTTM()?
18:59 sebastian2363: Its under the new "stock fundamentals" tab
18:59 MTS1: Oh; not a script?
19:00 sebastian2363: It is a script function
19:01 MTS1: daybuck; really/??? I know the answer, and so should you, we discussed them right in the beginning. It would have been much easier if you just were listening and honest / trying from the start.
19:03 MTS1: It does not seem like you've actually used TOS in the past 5 years and don't know how to add a built-in indicator? Do you know how to add a MA and change the settings? This is not a coding issue, this is PEBKAC.
19:04 amalia: I indulged you for more than a hour. MTS1 also concluded that we've gone full circle but you keep thinking otherwise. Here I am still replying back giving you the benefit of the doubt that you can somehow recover.
19:04 amalia: +1 MTS1
19:06 amalia: btw here are some of your pivots
def MonPivot = HL3(period = AggregationPeriod.MONTH);
def WeekPivot = HL3(period = AggregationPeriod.WEEK);
19:07 MTS1: Sebastian; have not played with those yet, but I'd try some different tickers.
19:07 amalia: daybuck has left the room. lol
19:08 amalia: "No one else can be right" attitude even when asking for help. smh -_-
19:09 sebastian2363: ok. thank you let me try
19:10 amalia: Room, what's a good way to collect Yearly OHLC values?
19:10 MTS1: But my indicator is special; I want it coded from scratch even if it already exists and I don't know what it does;)
19:11 MTS1: Amalia; O/C should be easy based on year change; would you want to use secondary aggregation for H/L or are you trying to keep it scanner friendly?
19:12 MTS1: H/L could be done that way also I guess based on year change; how many years back do you need though?
19:12 MTS1: Amalia; still there??? ;)
19:13 amalia: Yeah, going back and forth from Editor, chart then back here.
19:13 amalia: Funny link but this is what I have so far:
http://tos.mx/SedWed#
19:13 amalia: SedWed. lmao
19:17 MTS1: Not sure why yo have the extra if-then loop in there instead of 
def YearL = if YearChange==1 then L else if L<=YearL[1] then L else  YearL[1] ;
19:18 MTS1: but that's one way. Was thinking you wanted prior year OHLC which you could then carry forward. Or was thinking using monthly aggregation and getting highest, but this is easier.
19:19 amalia: I'm open to ideas really.
19:19 MTS1: (And the close obviously is the prior year's close).
19:19 MTS1: How are you using the values; how far back do you need OHLC, just prior year or current year?
19:20 amalia: This is what I'm trying to calculate:
def yearMinRange = Average(if YearC>=YearO then Min(YearH-YearC,YearO-YearL) else Min(YearH-YearO,YearC-YearL),10);
19:20 amalia: So I can't use Highest/Lowest cause that uses a rolling period
19:24 MTS1: are those current year values?
19:24 amalia: The ones in the label, yes.
19:24 MTS1: no hte yearMinRange def
19:24 MTS1: *the
19:25 amalia: Yes.
19:26 amalia: It's gonna be current until it's BNd I think
19:26 MTS1: Then you've got it already, except use the current close instead of tye Y one as that's last year's close.
19:27 amalia: But I'm trying to get last year's H/L. I can't use current values for calculation
19:27 fibfibfib: hey amalia, I just open your work on the yearly and it looks cool. Just a though, is it possible to include the open and closing price for yearly, monthly, quartley, weekly and daily?
19:27 MTS1: That's what I was asking;)
19:28 amalia: fibfibfib, it looks cool but it's not done yet. Will share when it's done.
19:28 fibfibfib: and on each line, add a bubble to say year open, year close...etc
19:29 MTS1: Then carry forward def PYH = if YearChange==1 then  YearO[1] else PYH[1]; ? 
19:29 MTS1: Sorry PYO in this case - PriorYearOpen; same for H/L
19:29 fibfibfib: thanks Amalia, MTS1.. im just beginning to learn so not as expert as you guys
19:30 fibfibfib: but so far, that's a very good idea to start on.
19:30 MTS1: WE NEED MORE BUBBLE (in SNL CowBell Voice)
19:32 amalia: lol
19:32 MTS1: Is that what you need Amalia, or am I missing something still?
19:33 amalia: Getting off desktop. that useless chat earlier fried my brain. gonna go get my green remedy on to get some cells back to attack this iead head on with more patience. =) MTS1, thanks for indulging
19:34 MTS1: lol, gn
19:34 amalia: =)
19:38 fibfibfib: don't go too long now, we need your brainpower. hahahaha
19:39 fibfibfib: just kidding

19:46 Mobius: yearly floor trader pivots. Someone asked for by email. So I posted them here for their group
19:46 DMonkey: late to the party but here since I was typing it out while that was being posted, you can have it any way....hahaha...was some logic to get you started.....
