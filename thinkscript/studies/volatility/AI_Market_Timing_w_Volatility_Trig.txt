#               v2 - 04-12-2017 - added VIX lookback (default to 1 month (21 days) as per article
#               v2              - added user defined cutoff (default 20, try 15 too)
#               v1 - 04-15-2017 - AI - Initial coding

#    High Volatility Regime (VIX > 20): volatility is more likely to remain elevated
#    Low Volatility Regime (VIX < 20): volatility is more likely to remain low

#    Low volatility regime (VIX < 20 or declining): 100% S&P 500 Index
#    High volatility regime (VIX > 20 and increasing): 100% Bloomberg Barclays US Intermediate Treasury Index
